# üìä Product Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is a Power BI report that provides clear insights into product performance, revenue generation, and category trends. It is designed to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions by visualizing key business metrics.

## üîç Project Overview

The dashboard answers key business questions such as:
- Which products generate the highest revenue?
- Which products are top sellers by volume?
- How is revenue distributed across categories?
- Which categories are the most popular?

## üßÆ Measures (DAX Calculations)

The following DAX measures were created to power the visualizations:

- **TotalUnitsSold**:
  ```dax
  TotalUnitsSold = SUM('TableName'[UnitsSold])
TotalRevenue:
TotalRevenue = SUMX('TableName', 'TableName'[UnitsSold] * 'TableName'[UnitPrice])
AvgRating:
AvgRating = AVERAGE('TableName'[Rating])
AvgPrice:
AvgPrice = AVERAGE('TableName'[UnitPrice])
